# Multi-Object Tracking Taxonomy  

This repository contains a taxonomy of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods, designed to provide an overview of recent MOT literature. The taxonomy was created as part of my thesis work and emphasizes our contribution, **[CAMELTrack](https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/CAMELTrack)**.  

The diagram was made using Lucidchart and is available in both JPEG and PDF formats:

## Contributions  

Contributions from the community are welcome! Feel free to submit suggestions to help improve this taxonomy. Creating this taxonomy was not an easy taskâ€”it is highly opinionated, and many methods are likely missing or could fit into multiple categories. Additionally, alternative categorizations could have been created, so any feedback or additions are greatly appreciated.
